<li>1. In a skillet, lightly toast the Spice Blend ingredients for a quick 2 minutes or until fragrant. In a large bowl, make the Yogurt Paste, add in all the toasted Spice Blend, mix well and set aside.
<br>
<br>
<li>2. Clean and pat dry the beef meat. With a knife, make 3-4 deep slits on parts of the meat, front and back. Coat chicken with blended Tandoori Spice paste, making sure extra marination goes into the slits of the meat. Marinade for 4-6 hours, preferably overnight.
<br>
<br>
<li>3. Preheat oven to 375 degree Fahrenheit. Line the baking sheet with aluminum foil and place the broiler rack over it. Place the whole rack in the oven for 10 minutes.
<br>
<br>
<li>4. Remove rack from the oven, place marinated meat in the oven and bake for 45 minutes. Flip the meat half way, and baste it with extra marinade and continue baking.  Reserve juice in the baking sheet, if any and pour juice over the chicken, cool down/refrigerate until ready for grill.
<br>
<br>
<li>5. Turn broiler oven or grill to High for 5-10 minutes. Cut the whole meat into 8 equal pieces and arrange them onto the grilling rack. Broil for 5-7 minutes on each side until the chicken is lightly charred and completely cooked.
<br>
<br>
<li>6. Remove from oven, and ready to serve with a bed of fresh salad, Naan bread or Raita.
