      <td width="277">Methods:

<li>1. Pour warm water over the egg noodles, soak for a few minutes, drain and separate carefully. (Don't worry if the noodles are too closely packed to separate - they will come apart as they cook in the wok.)

<li>2. Combine the marinade ingredients and stir through the chicken.

<li>3. Heat a wok until very hot and drizzle the oil around the edge. Add the ginger, then after a few seconds the garlic. Toss around in the oil until the garlic starts to brown, then add the chicken and stir-fry until it starts to brown. 

<li>4. Add the prawns, cabbage, carrot and sauce ingredients except the chicken stock. When the vegetables soften, add the stock and bring to the boil. Taste the sauce; it should be strong and flavourful. You may need to add a little salt.

<li>5. Add the noodles and stir to combine. Cook for about 2-3 minutes, or until the noodles are nearly al dente. 

<li>6. Pour over the corn?our mixture, stir-fry for a further 30 seconds and remove from the heat. Allow to stand for a few moments, then transfer to a plate, garnish with coriander and serve with lime and sliced chillies soaking in a little soy sauce.<br><br></td>
