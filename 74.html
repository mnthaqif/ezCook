    <td width="277"><br>Yong tau foo (also spelled yong tao foo, yong tau fu, yong tau hu or yong tofu; yentafo in Thailand) is a Hakka Chinese food consisting primarily of tofu that has been filled with either a ground meat mixture or fish paste (surimi). Variation of this food include vegetables and mushrooms stuff with ground meat or surimi. Yong tau foo is eaten in numerous ways, either dry with a sauce or served as a soup dish. <tr>

<li>1.Clean the okras and red chilies with water and slit in the middle (for stuffing). Discard the seeds of the red chilies, pat dry with paper towels. For the fried tofu puffs, poke an opening at the top surface with your finger (for stuffing). Set aside.
<br>
<br>
<li>2.Add white pepper powder, sesame oil, chopped scallion and red chili into the fish emulsion and mix well.
  <br>
<br>
<li>3.Stuff the fish paste into the red chilies, okras, and fried tofu puffs using a butter knife. Fill the inside of the red chilies, okras, and tofu puffs but make sure that you do not over-stuff them.
<br>
<br>
<li>4.Place the stuffed ingredients on a plate and steam for 5 minutes.
<br>
<br>
<li>5.Pan-fried the steamed Yong Tow Foo lightly with some cooking oil. Dish up.
  <br>
<br>

<li>6.Heat up some oil in a wok and stir-fry the chopped garlic until light brown or fragrant. Add the taucheo (yellow bean sauce) and do a quick stir. Add water and sugar. As soon as the sauce thickens, add the Yong Tow Foo into the wok and stir well. Serve hot.

<br>
<li>Cookâ€™s Notes:
<br>
<br>    
    For the above serving, you need only half of the fish paste.
    The above fish paste is my personal favorite but you can substitute it with another brand.
    A good fish paste should be light grey in color (like the color of fresh fish meat). If the fish meat emulsion turns light brown or darker grey, it means the product has been frozen for a long time.
