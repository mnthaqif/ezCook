    <td width="277"><br>Roti canai or roti cane is a type of Indian-influenced flatbread found in Malaysia, Indonesia and Singapore. It is often sold in Mamak stalls in Malaysia; also in Malay, Minangkabau and Aceh restaurants in Indonesia. It is known as roti prata in Southern Malaysia and Singapore, and is similar to the Indian Kerala porotta. It is also found throughout Thailand, where it is called "Ro Tee" and is typically sold by Muslims, most often with street carts, and is usually Halal.

<li>1. Mix salt to flour and knead it with milk. Keep aside for 2 hrs.
<br>
<br>
<li>2. Meanwhile, in a bowl, beat the eggs and add salt, chilli powder, chillies, chopped onions, coriander, cumin seeds. Mix them well.
<br>
<br>
<li>3. Take a small ball of dough, oil the work top with oil and work each ball into a very thin sheet - first flatten with your oiled palms, then thin it further by pulling the edges.
<br>
<br>
<li>4. Preheat a griddle, grease well with oil/ghee- when hot put roti dough on it.
<br>
<br>
<li>5. Now, gently pour the egg mixture on it and carefully spread over it.
<br>
<br>
<li>6. After 2 min, fold the edges of the roti dough over, just enough to seal the egg mixture in.
<br>
<br>
<li>7. Cook 2-3 mins till golden brown. Lift Roti with a spatula, grease the griddle with a tsp of oil, cook the other side.
<br>
<br>
<li>8. Serve hot with any spicy curry.
