    <td width="277"><br>Roti canai or roti cane is a type of Indian-influenced flatbread found in Malaysia, Indonesia and Singapore. It is often sold in Mamak stalls in Malaysia; also in Malay, Minangkabau and Aceh restaurants in Indonesia. It is known as roti prata in Southern Malaysia and Singapore, and is similar to the Indian Kerala porotta. It is also found throughout Thailand, where it is called "Ro Tee" and is typically sold by Muslims, most often with street carts, and is usually Halal.

<li>1.Combine the flour and salt in a large bowl. Make a well in the centre. Add the water and stir to combine. Use your hands to bring the dough together in the bowl. Turn onto a lightly floured surface and knead for 5 minutes or until smooth. Flatten the dough into a disc and cut into 8 equal portions.
<br>
<br>
<li>2.Shape each dough portion into a ball. Use a lightly floured rolling pin to roll out 1 portion of dough to a 20cm-diameter disc. Cover the remaining dough portions with plastic wrap. Brush the disc with a little melted butter. Roll into a log to enclose the butter. Coil the dough into a scroll shape. Flatten the scroll into a disc. Use a lightly floured rolling pin to roll out the disc until 15-20cm in diameter. Repeat with the remaining dough portions.
<br>
<br>
<li>3.Place a deep, heavy-based frying pan over medium-high heat and brush with a little oil. Cook 1 roti for 2 minutes each side or until puffed and golden. Transfer to a serving platter and cover with a clean tea towel to keep warm. Repeat with the remaining roti.
