<li>1.Heat a few lugs of the olive oil in a large pan on a med-high heat then add the onions, garlic, peppers and chilli powder. Fry for about 5 minutes, or until onions are softened and pale (not golden).<br><br>

<li>2.Add the chicken, with a pinch of salt and pepper, to the pan and cook until all the chicken is sealed, but not browning.<br><br>

<li>3.Keep on the heat and add the tomatoes, worcestershire sauce, juice of 1/2 a lemon, the chilli flakes and a good pinch of salt and pepper. Give a good stir and turn the heat up high. Let the sauce reach a boil and then reduce the heat to a med-low setting. Cover the pot and allow to simmer for 45 minutes, stirring occasionally.<br><br>

<li>4.With about 15 minutes left to cook, put on some pasta . I recommend a tagliatelle, fusilli, conchiglie or penne.<br><br>

<li>5.Once the sauce has been on for a good 45 minutes and has reduced slightly, remove from the heat and add the cheese. Stir to make sure it has melted through the sauce. Then drain off the pasta and add the the pot with the sauce, give a good stir to mix the pasta. Serve in a bowl, or high-edged plate, with some garlic bread on the side.
