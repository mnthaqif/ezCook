    <td width="277">Indonesian dictionary describes cendol as a snack made from rice flour and other ingredients that are formed by filters, then mixed with palm sugar and coconut milk (for beverage).There is a popular belief in Indonesia that the name "cendol" is related to, and originated from, the word jendol, in reference to the swollen green worm-like rice flour jelly<br><br></td>

<li>1.For Gula Melaka Syrup, combine in a small pan and bring to boil. When all the sugar is dissolved, take it off the heat, strain and set aside to cool.<br><br>

<li>2. To make the cendol, combine all the ingredients above in a mixing bowl. You can add some green food colouring if you want it greener, personally I don’t like that bright radioactive green that you get in commercial cendol.<br><br>

<li>3. Strain the mixture into a pan and cook on medium heat. It will start to coagulate at the bottom as the starches react to the heat so make sure you keep stirring it throughout so that it cooks evenly. Using a whisk is ok but as it thickens I find a silicone spatula much more handy. You can also use a Thermomix.<br><br>

<li>4. When the cendol starts to solidify and looks a bit translucent, it’s ready. At this stage it should not ribbon off your spatula but still quite soft and holds its shape somewhat.<br><br>

<li>5. Pop it hot into the piping bag you set aside earlier and pipe straight into the bowl of ice water. The ideal size is approx. 1.5 – 2 inches long and just slightly thicker than spaghetti.<br><br></td>
