<li>1.Mix the flour, baking powder, baking soda, sugar, and salt together in a bowl. Make a well in the centre and add the yogurt and oil. Add half the milk and mix everything together to form a ball. At this point, you need to gauge how much more milk to add. Your dough needs to be soft such that if you poke it with your finger, it leaves an indentation. Knead for 7 minutes until the dough is almost bubbling. 
<br>
<br>
<li>2.Keep covered in a warm place for 2 hours. Although the dough will rise, it will not double and may be slightly sticky to touch.
<br>
<br>
<li>3.Heat a heavy bottom skillet. Divide the dough into six balls. Roll each ball into the shape of a teardrop with the aid of extra flour. At this point, you can sprinkle whatever garnish you like such as coriander or leave it plain. Brush the other side of the naan with water and place the water side down onto the skillet. 
<br>
<br>
<li>4.Cover with a lid immediately. You will see the top of the naan bubbling. After a minute or so, turn the pan upside down so that the naan is exposed to the direct flames of the fire (the naan will stick to your pan because of the water) until the that side is cooked. This usually only takes a few seconds. Brush butter on the naan and serve immediately.
<br>
<br>
<li>5.If you donâ€™t have a direct flame, you can cook the top of the naan on the top rack in the oven under the grill or you can turn your skillet upside down over your electric hob (hold the skillet as close to the hob without touching it as possible).    </tr>
