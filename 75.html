    <td width="277"><br>Wonton noodles, sometimes called wanton mee ("wanton" is a Cantonese word for dumpling while noodles in Hokkien is "mee" or in Cantonese, "min") is a Cantonese noodle dish which is popular in Guangzhou, Hong Kong, Malaysia, Singapore and Thailand. The dish is usually served in a hot broth, garnished with leafy vegetables, and wonton dumplings. The types of leafy vegetables used are usually kai-lan also known as Chinese kale. Another type of dumpling known as shui jiao is sometimes served in place of wonton. It contains prawns, chicken, spring onions with some chefs adding mushroom and black fungus.

<li>1.Rinse the shrimp and pat dry with paper towels and then cut each shrimp into 3-4 pieces.
<br>
<br>
<li>2.Add half of the chopped yellow chives into the shrimp and marinate with the seasonings for 1 hour.
<br>
<br>
<li>3.Place a wonton wrapper on your palm and put about 1 teaspoon (about 3-4 pieces of the shrimp) filling in the center of the wonton wrapper. Gather the corners of the wrapper with the other hand and pinch in the middle to “seal” the wonton. Make sure the wontons are sealed tight. Repeat until the filling is used up.
<br>
<br>
<li>4.Prepare the soup first by bringing the chicken broth to boil. Add salt, white pepper, and sesame oil to taste.
<br>
<br>
<li>5.Heat up another pot with water. As soon as it boils, drop all wontons into the water. Stirring gently so the wontons don’t stick together. Continue to boil until the wontons are completely cooked and float to the top.
<br>
<br>
<li>6.Transfer the wontons out with a strainer and into the Soup and serve immediately.
