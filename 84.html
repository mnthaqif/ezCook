<li>1.Prepare the spice paste by using a mortar and pestle. First, pound the lemongrass and turmeric together until they become a paste.
<br>
<br>
<li>2.Deseed a big handful of dried red chilies. Soak in warm water for about 10 minutes. Pound the dried red chili into a fine paste. You will need about 20-25g depending how spicy you like. Save the unused chili paste in the refrigerator.
<br>
<br>
<li>3.Pound the shallots and the shrimp paste together.
<br>
<br>
<li>4.Mix the tamarind pulp and water using your fingers, extract the juice out of the tamarind pulp, discard the tamarind pulp and the seeds and save the tamarind juice.
<br>
<br>
<li>5.Heat up a pot on medium heat and add the oil. Saute the turmeric and lemongrass before adding the shallots and belacan paste. Continue to stir-fry until aromatic before adding the chili paste. Stir until the oil separates from the spice paste and become red.
<br>
<br>
<li>6.Add the tamarind juice into the pot, follow by the water. Bring it to boil before adding the polyganum leaves (laksa leaves) and okra. After the okra is half-cooked, add the fish head. Cover the pot and let cook for a few minutes until the fish is cooked. Add salt and sugar (if using) to taste. Garnish with the bunga kanta and mint leaves. Serve immediately.

<br>
Cook’s Notes:
<br>
<br>
<li>Use one lemongrass if it’s a big lemongrass and two if the lemongrass is thinner.
Fish head might sound intimidating to many of you, but it’s definitely one of the best parts of a fish—it’s fleshy, tender, and absolutely delicious. Curry Fish Head is a popular dish in Malaysia and Singapore.
