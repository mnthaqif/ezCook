    <td width="277" align="center"><br>Chicken chop is a quintessential Malaysian homegrown ‘western cuisine’. It was developed by the local Chinese of Hainanese origin who had been the cook for the British army and expatriates during the colonial era. They are capable cook who can dish out perfect western cuisine such as lamb chop, mushroom soup and steaks, but they also liked to incorporate the local cooking style into the cuisine. Since most Asians prefer chicken thigh over breast meat, they have developed a variation of ‘chops’ by using the de-boned chicken thigh and serve along with brown sauce or mushroom sauce. Since this concept is similar to prepare pork or lamb chops, it instantly became a favorite dish among the British as well as the locals. This dish has since become the most well-liked western food nowadays in Malaysia. Chicken chops are prepared only by using chicken thigh as it is more tender and juicy, in contrary to breast meat. This also explain why chicken chops remain as the local western food which is relatively less popular in the west.There are many variations to prepare chicken chops. It can be a breaded chicken chop with black pepper sauce, pan-fried or grilled to perfection and served with brown sauce or mushroom sauce. There is even chicken chop drizzled with sweet and spicy sauce served in one of the local coffee chains. The common side dishes served along with the chicken chop are coleslaw and French fries or mashed potatoes. Some restaurants also served along with garlic bread and salad.<br></td>
