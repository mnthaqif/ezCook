    <tr>
      <td width="277">Literally, the words "tom yum" are derived from two Thai words: "tom" and "yam". "Tom" refers to boiling process, while "yam" refers to a kind of Lao and Thai spicy and sour salad. Thus, "tom yum" is a Lao and Thai hot and sour soup. Indeed, tom yum is characterised by its distinct hot and sour flavours, with fragrant spices and herbs generously used in the broth. The basic broth is made of stock and fresh ingredients such as lemongrass, kaffir lime leaves, galangal, lime juice, fish sauce, and crushed chili peppers.<br><br></td>

      <td width="277">Method:

<li>1.Chop the vegetables and keep aside. Chop all the vegetables and keep all the ingredients. 

<li>2.Mix water, tom yum paste and bean sauce in a bowl and keep aside.

<li>3.Heat 1 tsp. of oil in a pan for the omelet. Lightly beat egg, pinch of salt and 1/8 tsp. of light soya sauce. Once the pan is hot, pour the beaten egg in the pan and spread it evenly turning the pan around. Cook for few seconds and carefully turn the omelet around. Once the omelet is fried, transfer to a plate and let it cool.

<li>4.Once cool, roll the omelet and cut it into thin strips.

<li>5.In a sauté pan or a wok heat 1 ½ tbsp. oil and fry the mince garlic. Be careful not to burn the garlic.

<li>7.Add onion and sauté for a minute until onions are soft.

<li>8.Add green beans and sauté for few seconds.

<li>9.Add tom yum mixture to the pan and cook for few seconds.

<li>10.Add vermicelli and give it a good stir.

<li>11.Add rest of the vegetables, soya sauce, pepper powder, salt and stir to mix well.

<li>12.Fry the vermicelli until vegetables and vermicelli are well cook. It does not take very long for the vermicelli to cook.

<li>13.Garnish with cilantro, scallions and omelet strips.

<li>14.Serve it as it is or with some chili sauce. This was my lunch Friday and felt I did not need any condiment to go with it.

<li>Suggestions:

<li>If using shrimp or chicken, add it after sautéing onions, after step 7. Once chicken or shrimp is cooked, add the green beans, and follow rest of the recipe.<br><br></td>
