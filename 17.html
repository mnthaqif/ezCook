      <td width="277">Soup tulang or bone soup is a dish consisting of mutton or beef bones stewed in a sweet and spicy red soup of mutton stock, tomatoes, ginger, chillies and spices. The dish is prized for the marrow contained in the bones. Although associated with the Indian Muslim community, the dish is considered a local innovation. To make soup tulang, ginger, garlic and chilli are first ground into a paste, traditionally with a mortar and pestle. Cumin and coriander seeds are then fried in oil or ghee. The ground chilli paste is added to the spices along with fenugreek and sugar. Mutton bone, ribs or beef bone that has been stewed for at least five hours is then fried in the mix of chillies and spices. Mutton or lamb stock is then added together with tomato puree, cinnamon sticks and cardamom pods. With tomatoes added to the stew, the mix is coloured a bright red and is sweeter than it is spicy. The dish is served hot, with slices of bread on the side as well as a straw. Diners usually eat the dish using their hands rather than cutlery in order to get to the meat on the bones more easily. The marrow is sucked out directly from the bone using the straw provided or is deftly knocked out. The bright red soup is mopped up with bread. <br><br></td>

      <td width="277">Methods:

<li>1. Boil steak bones with 1 tablespoon soup powder (rempah sup) till steak is tender, about 2 to 3 hours. But if using pressure cooker, it will take only 30 minutes or so.

<li>2. Grind garlic, onion and ginger.

<li>3. Heat a bit of oil in a pot. Add in chili paste and grinded ingredients. Fry till fragrant.

<li>4. Add in tender steak, tomato sauce and stock. Not too much stock as soup is supposed to be rather thick.

<li>5. Add in salt, a bit of sugar, white pepper and zeal.

<li>6. Add in potato puree and stir till thickens.

<li>7. Finally add in an egg, stir for just a little while and remove from heat.<br><br></td>
