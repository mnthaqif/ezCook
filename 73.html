    <td width="277"><br>Sizzling yee mee with braised chicken and mushrooms is a common dish where you can find it in most central Malaysia's food courts.It is also known as e-fu noodles, yee-fu noodles, yi noodles, or yifu noodles. It is a variety of flat Cantonese egg noodles made from wheat flour. They are known for their golden yellow color and chewy characteristics. The slightly chewy and slightly spongy texture of the noodles is due to the soda water used in making the dough (as opposed to regular non-carbonated water), which was then fried and dried into flat patty-like dried bricks. <br>
