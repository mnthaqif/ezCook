    <td width="277"><br>Roti canai or roti cane is a type of Indian-influenced flatbread found in Malaysia, Indonesia and Singapore. It is often sold in Mamak stalls in Malaysia; also in Malay, Minangkabau and Aceh restaurants in Indonesia. It is known as roti prata in Southern Malaysia and Singapore, and is similar to the Indian Kerala porotta. It is also found throughout Thailand, where it is called "Ro Tee" and is typically sold by Muslims, most often with street carts, and is usually Halal.

<li>1. Into the breadmaker pan, pour in the water and egg. Add sugar, salt and bread softener.
<br>
<br>
<li>2. Top it with flour, milk powder, bread improver and instant dried yeast.
<br>
<br>
<li>3. Set the bread maker to DOUGH setting and press start. When the dough is just combined, add in 80g margarine. Leave the bread maker to finish the cycle which takes about 1 1/2 hour or so.
<br>
<br>
<li>4. Remove the dough from the pan and divide the dough into 20 equal portions. Roughly about 49 to 50g each.
<br>
<br>
<li>5. Form each portion into a ball and arrange on a baking tray. Leave to rise for another 30 minutes or so.
<br>
<br>
<li>6. Before baking, brush the dough with some fresh milk and use a scissor to cut the top of the dough.
<br>
<br>
<li>7. Place a dollop of Planta margarine on top and sprinkle with some coarse sugar.
<br>
<br>
<li>8. Bake in a pre-heated oven at 180c for 20 to 25 minutes or till golden brown.
<br>
<br>
<li>9. Once out of the oven, brush with a bit of butter. Place on a wire rack to cool. Keep in an airtight container.
